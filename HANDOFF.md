# MNS-2 / Navier–Stokes flow-map bridge handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-17 JST.

This is the short-form continuation point for future GPT sessions. The repository is expected to be developed primarily through repeated GPT sessions; do not rely on chat history as durable state.

## Resume protocol

Follow `docs/GPT_WORKFLOW.md`. Read, in order:

1. `PROJECT_GOAL.md`;
2. `SPEC.md`;
3. `AGENTS.md`;
4. `FORMAL_SCOPE.md`;
5. this file;
6. `docs/LEAN_CI_OPERATIONS.md`;
7. current GitHub `main`, relevant `Formal/` files, open PRs, and latest Lean verification evidence.

Current code and theorem statements override stale prose.

## Repository / verification state

- PR #77 (`Cut hosted Lean CI usage and add cache`) is merged.
- PR #78 (`Gpt handoff protocol`) is merged.
- PR #79 (`R3 young real set integral bridge`) is merged.
- PR #80 (`Close R3 Schwartz H3-to-H2 convection factors`) is merged.
- PR #81 (`Agent/chatgpt external lean workflow`) is merged as
  `710709c34b8ee564b071e71fd27313be4cc383a6`.
- PR #81 head `18c64b80b6eebb95a4344dec5811fc024b963377` passed hosted Lean run #257
  (`31924077773`). Its Git tree is identical to merge commit `710709c...`; the merge SHA itself has
  no separately attached run.
- At session resume, `main` was `710709c34b8ee564b071e71fd27313be4cc383a6` and there were no
  open PRs.
- The current mathematical work is on `agent/r3-schwartz-convection-h3-estimate`; code commit
  `6ecfcda51d74b456b538def2577c52a403a0ff88` passed the local pinned source scan and full
  `Formal.+` gate (8735 jobs).
- The same commit also passed targeted builds of
  `Formal.R3SchwartzConvectionSobolevEstimate` and `Formal.AxiomAudit`.
- No GitHub Action was started or rerun for the new mathematical proof.
- Automatic full Lean builds on pushes to `main` remain disabled.
- Opening a PR to `main` currently starts the hosted Lean workflow, so a no-Actions integration must
  not use a PR merely as a merge vehicle.
- The preferred interactive path is now **ChatGPT -> external Lean runner -> exact diagnostics -> ChatGPT iteration** under the contract in `docs/LEAN_CI_OPERATIONS.md`.
- Local/self-hosted execution remains a valid reproduction/fallback path.
- GitHub-hosted Actions should be used only for deliberately spent status/final-confirmation checks or when repository integration policy explicitly requires one.

## Local Lean status in this workspace

The VS Code Lean extension, Elan shims, and pinned Lean 4.32.1 toolchain are installed locally. The
only environment issue found was an unset `ELAN_HOME`. The tested PowerShell setup is:

```powershell
$env:ELAN_HOME = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.elan'
```

With that process-local setting, `lean --version`, `lake --version`, targeted builds, the axiom
audit, and the full gate all run locally. The extension provides the IDE/LSP integration; the actual
verification is performed by the local Elan-selected Lean compiler and kernel.

## Project claim boundary

Ultimate target: an exact official Clay/Fefferman Navier–Stokes A/B/C/D statement.

Current physical research specialization remains the `R^3`, preferably unforced `f = 0`, axisymmetric-with-swirl breakdown track governed by `SPEC.md`.

No current Lean theorem is a Clay result. Do not claim global regularity, blow-up, local well-posedness of the full concrete `R^3` problem, finite-cylinder transfer, or discrete-to-continuum promotion unless separately proved.

## Completed formal target

The previous near-term target

`R3SchwartzConvectionTermSobolevEstimate 3`

is now proved as `r3SchwartzConvectionTermSobolevEstimate_three` in
`Formal/R3SchwartzConvectionSobolevEstimate.lean`.

The same file proves `r3SchwartzConvectionSobolevEstimate_three`, obtaining the full
`R3SchwartzConvectionSobolevEstimate 3` through the existing `.to_convection` reduction and its
documented factor-three summation loss.

The new active target is the density/bounded-extension step from this Schwartz-core estimate to a
completed Bessel-coordinate `H³ × H³ → H²` bilinear convection map.

## Merged infrastructure through PR #80

### Representative/Fubini bridge — PR #79

The old ordinary-scalar-convolution versus bundled-Bochner representative blocker is closed for the two concrete H² majorants.

Relevant merged files/theorems include:

- `Formal/R3YoungRealSetIntegralBridge.lean`;
- `Formal/R3YoungRealConvolutionCommutativity.lean`;
- `Formal/R3SchwartzMajorantYoungRepresentative.lean`:
  - `coeFn_r3H2RightMajorantYoungL2_eq_scalarMajorant`;
  - `coeFn_r3H2LeftMajorantYoungL2_eq_scalarMajorant`;
- `Formal/R3SchwartzScalarMajorantL2.lean`;
- `Formal/R3SchwartzConvectionH2L2Majorant.lean`:
  - `norm_r3H2WeightedVelocitySchwartz_fourier_convectionTerm_toLp_le_scalarMajorants`;
  - `norm_r3H2WeightedVelocitySchwartz_fourier_convectionTerm_toLp_le_YoungFactors`.

Do not generalize that representative/Fubini identification to unrelated convolution objects without another explicit theorem.

### Fourier-coordinate and H³ closure — PR #80

`Formal/R3H2CoordinateFourierBounds.lean` now proves:

- `fourier_r3SchwartzCoordinate_eq`;
- `integral_norm_fourier_r3SchwartzCoordinate_le_H3`;
- `norm_r3H2WeightedScalarSchwartz_fourier_coordinate_toLp_le_H3`.

The exact coordinate/Fourier identity

`𝓕 (r3SchwartzCoordinate i f) = r3SchwartzCoordinate i (𝓕 f)`

is therefore green and no longer an open bridge.

`Formal/R3SchwartzConvectionH3Closure.lean` now proves:

- `norm_r3H2WeightedVelocitySchwartz_fourier_convectionTerm_toLp_le_H3`;
- `norm_r3SchwartzToHsCLM_two_convectionTerm_le_H3`.

The proved physical per-coordinate estimate is

`‖r3SchwartzToHsCLM 2 (r3SchwartzConvectionTerm i u v)‖`

`≤ 4 * ‖r3H2InverseBesselWeightL2‖ * r3CoordinateDerivativeFrequencyConstant i * ‖r3SchwartzToHsCLM 3 u‖ * ‖r3SchwartzToHsCLM 3 v‖`.

Also already available:

`r3CoordinateDerivativeFrequencyConstant_nonneg (i : Fin 3)`.

### Uniform finite-coordinate closure — locally verified commit `6ecfcda...`

`Formal/R3SchwartzConvectionSobolevEstimate.lean` adds:

- `r3UniformCoordinateDerivativeFrequencyConstant`;
- `r3UniformCoordinateDerivativeFrequencyConstant_nonneg`;
- `r3CoordinateDerivativeFrequencyConstant_le_uniform`;
- `r3SchwartzConvectionH3Constant`;
- `r3SchwartzConvectionH3Constant_nonneg`;
- `r3SchwartzConvectionTermSobolevEstimate_three`;
- `r3SchwartzConvectionSobolevEstimate_three`.

The uniform derivative constant is the finite sum over `Fin 3`. Each coordinate constant is
nonnegative, so every summand is bounded by that sum. The common per-term witness is

`4 * ‖r3H2InverseBesselWeightL2‖ * r3UniformCoordinateDerivativeFrequencyConstant`.

`Formal/AxiomAudit.lean` now prints the axiom dependencies of both final estimate theorems. They
use only the standard mathlib foundations reported by the rest of this development (`propext`,
`Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`).

## Exact next Lean gate

Do not reopen the Fourier-coordinate or representative/Fubini work unless the current source actually regresses.

The next smallest mathematical task is no longer finite-dimensional constant packaging. It is the
completion bridge:

1. prove the density/extension facts required to promote the bounded Schwartz-core bilinear map;
2. construct a continuous bilinear map on the completed Bessel-coordinate carriers with type
   corresponding to `H³ × H³ → H²`;
3. prove exact agreement with `r3SchwartzConvection` on canonical Schwartz inputs;
4. only then construct the real-valued/solenoidal restriction and compose with the concrete Leray
   projector for the projected quadratic / mild-theory layer.

Do not define the completed map by choosing an arbitrary Schwartz representative or approximating
sequence without proving independence of that choice and the required density/continuity result.

```

## Runner protocol for the next proof

Use a conforming ChatGPT-accessible Lean runner when connected; otherwise use the tested local
Elan path above. In either case, preserve the same pinned-revision evidence contract.

For each candidate change, record:

```text
runner: <tool/provider>
revision: <commit SHA or exact candidate patch>
toolchain: <value from lean-toolchain>
scope: <target module or full gate>
result: <pass/fail>
diagnostics: <exact Lean error when failing>
```

Preferred iteration:

```text
smallest target
-> exact Lean diagnostic
-> minimal proof edit
-> same target again
-> full pinned gate after target is green
```

Do not use GitHub-hosted PR runs as the diagnostic loop.

## Nonclaims / guardrails

- no `sorry`;
- no `admit`;
- no new local `axiom`;
- no source-level `opaque` proof hiding;
- do not report candidate code as proved before a conforming pinned Lean verification accepts it;
- do not merge an ungreen mathematical PR;
- do not auto-merge unless the user explicitly asks;
- the proved Schwartz-core estimate does not yet supply a map on the completed Sobolev carriers;
- it does not yet supply the real-valued, solenoidal, or Leray-projected quadratic map;
- do not spend hosted Actions as an interactive compiler while quota is scarce/exhausted.

## Minimal continuation prompt

`@GitHub ns-mns2-flowmap-bridge を docs/GPT_WORKFLOW.md の resume protocol どおり確認して、最新 main/PR/Lean verification と HANDOFF.md を照合して続きから。現在の次ゲートは Schwartz 核の H³×H³→H² 対流評価を completed Sobolev carrier へ延長する density/bounded-extension bridge。Lean はローカルまたは接続済み外部 runner で反復し、GitHub Actions は明示的に必要な場合だけ使って。古い会話より実コードを優先して。`
